# Method_Definition_And_Usage

This project is a beginner-friendly Java application that demonstrates how to define and use methods in a class. The focus is on creating methods with parameters, returning values, and using these methods in a program.

---

## Features
- **Basic Method Definition**: Includes examples of methods with and without parameters.
- **Return Values**: Methods that return integer or double values.
- **Error Handling**: Handles division by zero with a simple message.
- **Interactive Demonstration**: A `main` method to showcase method calls and their outputs.

## Code Overview

### 1. `Calculator` Class
- Contains methods for basic arithmetic operations:
    - `add(int a, int b)` - Returns the sum of two integers.
    - `subtract(int a, int b)` - Returns the difference of two integers.
    - `multiply(int a, int b)` - Returns the product of two integers.
    - `divide(double a, double b)` - Returns the quotient of two numbers, with zero-division handling.
- Includes a `printGreeting()` method to display a welcome message.

### 2. `MethodDefinitionAndUsage` Class
- Demonstrates the usage of methods in the `Calculator` class.
- Contains the `main` method to execute the program and display outputs.
